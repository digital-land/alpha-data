# Development policy and local plans data

See https://digital-land.github.io/specification/

These files are to be moved into a separate development-policy-collection.

The data was seeded from
[a Planning Inspectorate list](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/777040/LPA_Strategic_Plan_Progress_-_1_February_2019._GOV.UK.pdf) and was subsequently updated by planning policy colleagues using the [local plans prototype](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/local-plans).

The intention is for the national categories and policies to kept and maintained in registers operated by MHCLG, and for data about individual local plans to be collected and assembled from data made available by individual Local Planning Authorities.
